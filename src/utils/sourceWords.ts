/**
 * Locating spoken text back in the note's markdown.
 *
 * What the engine speaks is not what the note contains: the pipeline strips
 * markup, may spell out acronyms, and can skip URLs and code blocks. So a
 * character offset in the spoken text means nothing in the source, and the two
 * have to be re-aligned by content.
 *
 * Both sides are reduced to a stream of comparable words — lowercased, stripped
 * of punctuation — with the source words keeping their offsets in the original
 * markdown. Matching then walks forward through the source with a bounded
 * look-ahead, so inserted or dropped words cost at most a local mismatch instead
 * of desynchronising the rest of the note.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so the alignment can be unit-tested on its own.
