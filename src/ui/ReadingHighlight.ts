 * Follow-along highlighting in the note while it is read.

 * A CodeMirror decoration marks the passage currently being spoken, and a second
 * one marks the word inside it when the engine reports word boundaries (the
 * on-device provider does; a cloud provider handing back an MP3 cannot).
 *
 * Positions are resolved by content rather than by offset — see sourceWords.ts —
 * because the spoken text has been through the markdown pipeline and no longer
 * lines up with the note. Anchoring each word search inside the already-located
 * passage keeps a mis-match local instead of letting it drift down the note.
